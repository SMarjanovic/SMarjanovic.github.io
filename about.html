                                         <h3>family</h3>
                                         <p>Since I am recently married this summer, I have gained some family members.  The photo above was taken by our fabulous wedding photographer, <a href="http://www.sharonguillotte.com/">Sharon Guillotte</a>.  
                                         Family is very important to us.  My family is on the left and my husband's family is on the right.  
                                         Presently, we've seen a lot of my family since we try to help out with harvest in the fall.  
                                         My family owns and operates a farm in southern Illinois.  It is a busy season for them currently.  
                                         My husband's parents are located in Urbana, and his sister is pursuing her master's degree in architecture in Philadelphia. 
                                         We try to spend as much time as we can with our family.</p>

                                        <p>I am an artist.  I earned my bachelor's degree in fine art from <abbr title="Eastern Illinois University"> EIU </abbr> in Charleston and my master's degree in fine art at <abbr title="Southern Illinois University"> SIU </abbr> Edwardsville.  
                                            I am currently pursuing a certificate in graphic design in Parkland College.  I am hoping that adding to my skill set will help me find a job in graphic design or a job related to the arts in some way.  
                                            I am qualified to teach at the university or college level, and I have had some experience working in a gallery as well.  Recently I worked at the <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/organization/">Illinois Natural History Survey</a> in 
                                            the <dfn>herbarium</dfn> which "is a collection of preserved plant specimens and associated data used for scientific study" (<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbarium">wikipedia.com</a></cite>) as  digitizer. I took pictures of 
                                            plant specimens, collected significant data, and uploaded both to a online public database. You can can visit the online database, Consortium of Midwest Herbaria <a href="http://midwestherbaria.org/portal/index.php"><mark>here.</mark></a></p>

                                        <h3>personal interests</h3>
                                        <p>I am passionate about the outdoors and our native habitats and ecosystems.  My family and I enjoy spending time outside hiking, swimming, canoeing, and kayaking. 
                                            We also enjoy managing our lands set aside on our family farm for habitat restoration.  On the farm we have prairies, woodlands, and wetlands.  The environment and habitat restoration is a major theme in my artwork.    
                                            Besides spending time outdoors, I enjoy gardening, cooking, and reading a good book. Mostly, if I can work on a creative project with my hands, life is good.  I also enjoy traveling.  My husband and I travelled to Italy this summer for our honeymoon.  
                                            It was a once in a lifetime experience.  My husband has family in Europe so we are planning to visit them in the future.  There are a lot of places I would like to explore both in the States and abroad.  Lastly, I enjoy spending time with friends and family.
